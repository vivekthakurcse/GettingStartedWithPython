# variables in python
# variables is nothing more but a container for storing data\values in it. There is np need to declare variable before its use.
# we dont need to data type here because python understands its data type by itself

# integer variables
a = 1
# floating point variables
b = 1.2345
# string variables
name = "vivek"
print("\n integer = " , a , "\n floating point = " , b , "\n string = " + name)

# Q1> take a string and print its length
name = "panda"

print("\n name length = " , len(name))
